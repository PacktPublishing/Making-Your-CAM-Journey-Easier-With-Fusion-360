## What is this book about?
Downloading a piece of 3D software and shaping concepts and ideas is quite easy. However, designing feasible and cost-effective real parts from 3D models can be challenging with traditional production technologies, or even additive manufacturing. This book will give you the know-how and skills to develop your projects from ideas to physical products, and overcome these obstacles.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Choose the best approach for different parts and shapes
* Avoid design flaws from a manufacturing perspective
* Discover the different machining strategies
* Understand how different tool geometries can influence machining results
* Discover how to check the tool simulation for errors
* Understand possible fixtures for raw material blocks
* Become proficient in optimizing parameters for your machine
* Explore machining theory and formulas to evaluate cutting parameters

## Get to Know the Author

**Fabrizio Cimoâ€™** 
is an Italian industrial designer and mechanical engineer that has always been passionate about 3D software, rendering, virtual reality, and open-source philosophy. In 2007, this passion led him to create his YouTube channel with lessons on several 3D design tools like Rhinoceros, Blender, Unreal Engine, Fusion 360, and Keyshot. During his second college degree, Autodesk discovered his videos and asked him to join the Student Ambassador program on Fusion 360 in order to promote the use of the software in Italy to students. After the degree he was hired as a machine designer for the manufacturing of PCB and other electronic components. Today, Fabrizio works as a mechanical designer for industrial laser cutting machines.
